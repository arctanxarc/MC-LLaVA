|The vanilla LLaVA fails to understand user-provided concepts. Existing methods like Yo'LLaVA mainly focus on single-concept personalization. Our proposed MC-LLaVA learns multiple concepts and can perform accurately in multi-concept personalization across various tasks such as recognition, VQA, and caption.|

> **Abstract**: Current vision-language models (VLMs) show exceptional abilities across diverse tasks including visual question answering. To enhance user experience in practical applications, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits the real-world applicability of personalized VLMs. In this paper, we propose the first multi-concept personalization method named MC-LLaVA along with a high-quality multi-concept personalization dataset. Specifically, MC-LLaVA uses a joint training strategy incorporating multiple concepts in a single training step, allowing VLMs to perform accurately in multi-concept personalization. To reduce the cost of joint training, MC-LLaVA leverages visual token information for concept token initialization, yielding improved concept representation and accelerating joint training. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants.

## Dataset

### Download

The multi-concept personalized dataset proposed in our paper can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1088_EQXaURmpNcc0SLPVX3glmKZ4HBDQ/view?usp=sharing).

### Introduction

The dataset is a visual-language dataset tailored for multi-concept scenario customization in Vision-Language Models (VLM). It includes: 99 images sourced from the open dataset [CC12M](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-12m), 1,595 screenshots from 40 films and TV shows, and 12,639 Q&A pairs generated by GPT-4o.

Specifically, the dataset comprises 40 scenarios (one film or TV show corresponds to one scenario), each with several (2 to 4) characters. Each character is represented by 15 images and several corresponding Q&A pairs. Additionally, each scenario includes a set of images featuring multiple characters along with corresponding Q&A pairs.

| Number of Characters per Scenario | Number of Scenarios | Number of Images | Number of  Q&A Pairs |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 2                                 | 30                  | 1050             | 7950                |
| 3                                 | 7                   | 350              | 2940                |
| 4                                 | 3                   | 195              | 1749                |
